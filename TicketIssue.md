# PROJECT ISSUE TICKET


## Unexpected Behavior

My mock data is not seeding to the database. (remind me to ask about views in rails vs react, <%= text_field ‘invoiceitems[]’, ‘item_price’ %>
<%= text_field ‘invoiceitems[]’, ‘item_qty’ %> etc.)

## Expected Behavior

Mock data is seeded sucessfully so I can do the rendering on the front end.

## Reproduce the Error

Download repo and run all necessary commands to make it run. Try to seed data locally.
